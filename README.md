# http-server
An Asynchronous HTTP server that makes use of Boost::asio libraries and written in C++.

## Goal

The goal of this project is to try to build a working simple C++ server from the ground up by using Boost::Asio libraries. The server will eventually be asynchronous and be capable of handling multiple requests at a time.

This project does not make use of Boost::Beast for Http requests, although I might decide to implement it on a later date.
